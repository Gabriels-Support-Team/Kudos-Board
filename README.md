### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes pretty well. The labs and lectures were full of great content that was very useful there was just not enough time to soak it all up meaningfully

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have added the users features. I would add meaningful comments to my code. I would make more code more modular to make it easier to iterate on. I would clean up all unnecassary lines that remained after edits.


* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I think copying over alot of the board code to the cards code went very well. it was very reusable. My peers added comments as a sepereate prisma table so that they could maintain properties for each comment but I did not.
### Open-source libraries used
